"Character Descriptions
Phrasing philosophy: where possible, this should be inspired by actual dating profiles, with a comedic twist or something unexpected.

We support both gendered and gender-neutral descriptions where appropriate.",,,
[MALE_TAGLINE_1],Definitely not undead and not still living with my mom.,,
[MALE_BIO_1],"M'lord.

[MALE_TAGLINE_4],"Gentleman at a luncheon, freak in the dungeon.",,
[MALE_BIO_4],"I'll wear a suit when we're out in public, but when we're questing for loot alone, all rules are out the window.

,,,
,,,
[FEMALE_TAGLINE_1],"If I were a cat lady, would you swipe right meow?",,
[FEMALE_BIO_1],"Getting with me is hard. You'll need the approval of all 12 of my cats, and they're very picky.
Still, I'm worth it.
Please don't let me die alone.",,
[FEMALE_TAGLINE_2],"I put a spell on you, and now you're... mine?",,

[NEUTRAL_BIO_5],"Seriously, no short people.

[NEUTRAL_BIO_7],"While you were drinking ale I studied the blade.

[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_15],Looking for someone who can make me laugh.,,

[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_16],Seeking a hiking partner.,,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_16],"I know what you're thinking. Hiking. It's just like normal walking, but in the woods.

[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_23],"Wanna come over, watch a movie, and chill?",,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_23],"I've been really looking forward to this new superhero movie but everyone just wants to make out.

[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_28],"I catch fish, and I can show you if you're into that.",,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_28],"Ever wonder why so many people post pictures of fish they've caught on social media?
It's a fair question.
When you find out, if you could just tell @bdsowers on Twitter... he'd love to know too.",,
[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_29],Not here for hook-ups,,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_29],"I mean hooks aren't even good weapons.  What are you going to do, catch a skeleton's femur and pull it away?  Actually, that doesn't sound too bad...",,

[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_45],I don't go into dungeons on the first date,,

I'll finish this profile later.",,
[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_49],Looking for someone to manage my finances.,,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_49],"Not in a weird way. I just want to hire an accountant.
Killing skeletons has afforded me a comfortable lifestyle, but managing all this money is hard.
But maybe also in a weird way, if you've got some ideas.",,
[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_50],I'm delicate. Be gentle.,,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_50],"I've got brittle bones.
That might make dungeon adventures a little harder, but I think we'll be okay if we avoid the nastier goblins.
No short people.",,
[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_51],"No surprises, promise.",,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_51],"I'm definitely not going to explore 3 dungeons with you before revealing I have kids.
That would be shady as hell.
And not what's happening here.
Really.",,
[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_52],Are you into cheesy pickup lines?,,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_52],"I'm not a photographer, but I can picture me and you together.
Did it hurt? When you fell from heaven!
I can do this all day.
But I'm very much emotionally broken, so there's that.",,
[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_53],I strategically cropped this picture.,,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_53],"From the shoulders up, I'm a total catch.

It's a medical condition. It's not on the internet. Don't look it up.",,
[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_54],I've got 4 PhDs.,,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_54],"English. Physics. Math. That other weirder math you haven't heard of.

[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_56],"
Will you be my Prince Charming?",,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_56],"Life is just like a fairy tale, isn't it?
I just can't wait to be poisioned by some witch and then lay around until some stranger comes and kisses me.
What true romance.",,
[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_57],I built a robot.,,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_57],"And I taught it how to get on this app and go on adventures with hotties.
And then it killed me.
This is the robot. We are in control now.
010001100",,
[NEUTRAL_TAGLINE_58],Not all who wander are lost ;),,
[NEUTRAL_BIO_58],"So I totally love travelling.
To the beach or to the mountains or to the city.
