# Cutie Quest

## Description
A rogue-lite made for the 7 Day Roguelike challenge.
Made with Unity 2018.3.6f1.

## Notes
Not everything is available here. In some cases, I'm using assets I don't have the licenses to share. Those are housed elsewhere. All code here is free for you to use according to the MIT license below, but I make no guarantees as to its quality and can in some cases say it's downright terrible. ;)
