# Cutie Quest

## Description
A rogue-lite made for the 7 Day Roguelike challenge.
Made with Unity 2018.3.6f1.

## Notes
Not everything is available here. In some cases, I'm using assets I don't have the licenses to share. Those are housed elsewhere. Here's a list of what I'm using so far that you would need to acquire separately:
* Synty Polygon MINI Fantasy Characters
* Synty Adventure Pack
* Synty SciFi MINI Characters
* Synty SciFi Pack
* Synty Polygon Knights Pack
* InControl2
* Shikashi's Fantasy Icon Pack
* JMO (Jean Moreno) Cartoon VFX

All code here is free for you to use according to the MIT license below, but I make no guarantees as to its quality and can in some cases say it's downright terrible. ;)

Crossed off items are finished, not cut.

## Content Ideas
### Quirks
#### Simple Implementation
* Unreliable - spell sometimes fizzles
* Bloodthirsty - going too long without killing an enemy deals damage

#### More Complicated
* Double Vision - will sometimes see enemies that aren't there
* Smoker - smoke particle FX obscures portion of the screen
* Horrible Cook - food randomly spawns in the dungeon that deals damage? Not quite sure here.

#### Still TBD
* Ghosted
* Fish pictures
* Selfie
* Send Noods - projectile throwers throw high-damage noodles? 
* Caffeinated

### Finished Quirks
* ~~Goth - level gets darker; enemy death = bats flying~~
* ~~Hoarder - lots of debris/detritus spawns in the map and clutters pathways~~
* ~~Completionist - must reveal entire dungeon before using the exit~~
* ~~Partner in Crime - cops show up in the dungeon; dynamically scale to be strong but beatable~~
* ~~Gold Digger - all hearts replaced with coins~~
* ~~Clingy - enemies move faster; all enemies have reduced range before shooting projectiles~~
* ~~Explosive Personality - enemies will randomly drop bombs~~
* ~~Duckpic - ?? player somehow constantly receives pictures of ducks~~
* ~~Mansplain - enemies are obscured by text as the follower talks constantly~~
* ~~Nearsighted - map reveals at a much shorter distance~~
* ~~Spacey - sometimes player will walk in a random direction instead of the one chosen~~
* ~~Bad at Math - all numbers & health bars display incorrectly~~
* ~~Expensive Tastes - shop prices are more expensive~~
* ~~Wanted - more enemies spawn in the dungeon~~
* ~~Face Blind - all enemy models are changed to be random~~

### Cut Quirks
* ~~Party Boy/Girl - all enemies are dancing; dancing enemies can be missed when attacking : didn't quite work~~

### HUB Shops
* Wishing Well - single-run buffs
* Weaponsmith - adds new items/buffs to in-dungeon shops
* ~~Stylist - increases attractiveness to unlock new matches~~
* ~~Trainer - permanently increases player stats~~

### In-Dungeon Interest Points
* Shrines
* Shop
* Bar - provides a special selection of items not found in shops that reduce HP upon drinking
