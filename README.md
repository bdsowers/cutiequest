# Cutie Quest

## Description
A rogue-lite made for the 7 Day Roguelike challenge.
Made with Unity 2018.3.6f1.

## Notes
Not everything is available here. In some cases, I'm using assets I don't have the licenses to share. Those are housed elsewhere. All code here is free for you to use according to the MIT license below, but I make no guarantees as to its quality and can in some cases say it's downright terrible. ;)

## Content Ideas
### Quirks
* Boring - no effect
* Mansplain - enemies are obscured by text as the follower talks constantly
* Nearsighted - map reveals at a much shorter distance
* Duckpic - ?? player somehow constantly receives pictures of ducks
* Unreliable - spell sometimes fizzles
* Ice Queen - when hit, the player has a chance of being frozen for a short period
* Spacey - sometimes player will walk in a random direction instead of the one chosen
* Gold Digger - follower takes half of all your money
* Toxic - player starts each floor poisoned
* Bad at Math - all numbers & health bars display incorrectly
