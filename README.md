# Cutie Quest

## Description
A rogue-lite made for the 7 Day Roguelike challenge.
Made with Unity 2018.3.6f1.

## Notes
Not everything is available here. In some cases, I'm using assets I don't have the licenses to share. Those are housed elsewhere. Here's a list of what I'm using so far that you would need to acquire separately:
* Synty Polygon MINI Fantasy Characters
* Synty Adventure Pack
* Synty SciFi MINI Characters
* Synty SciFi Pack
* Synty Polygon Knights Pack
* InControl2
* Shikashi's Fantasy Icon Pack
* JMO (Jean Moreno) Cartoon VFX

All code here is free for you to use according to the MIT license below, but I make no guarantees as to its quality and can in some cases say it's downright terrible. ;)

## Content Ideas
### Quirks
* Boring - no effect
* Mansplain - enemies are obscured by text as the follower talks constantly
* Nearsighted - map reveals at a much shorter distance
* Duckpic - ?? player somehow constantly receives pictures of ducks
* Unreliable - spell sometimes fizzles
* Ice Queen - when hit, the player has a chance of being frozen for a short period
* Spacey - sometimes player will walk in a random direction instead of the one chosen
* Gold Digger - follower takes half of all your money
* Toxic - player starts each floor poisoned
* Bad at Math - all numbers & health bars display incorrectly
* Ghosted - spell sometimes passes through enemies
* Expensive Tastes - shop prices are more expensive

### HUB Shops
* Stylist - increases attractiveness to unlock new matches
* Trainer - permanently increases player stats
* Wishing Well - single-run buffs
* Weaponsmith - adds new items/buffs to in-dungeon shops

### Biomes
* Basic dungeon
* Spaceship
* ???

### Spells
* Haste
* Fireball - straight projectile
* Ice Blast - radial, short range blast
