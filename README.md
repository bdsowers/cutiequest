# Cutie Quest

## Description
A rogue-lite made for the 7 Day Roguelike challenge.
Made with Unity 2018.3.6f1.

## Notes
Not everything is available here. In some cases, I'm using assets I don't have the licenses to share. Those are housed elsewhere. Here's a list of what I'm using so far that you would need to acquire separately:
* Synty Polygon MINI Fantasy Characters
* Synty Adventure Pack
* Synty SciFi MINI Characters
* Synty SciFi Pack
* Synty Polygon Knights Pack
* InControl2
* Shikashi's Fantasy Icon Pack
* JMO (Jean Moreno) Cartoon VFX

All code here is free for you to use according to the MIT license below, but I make no guarantees as to its quality and can in some cases say it's downright terrible. ;)

Crossed off items are finished, not cut.

## Content Ideas
### Quirks
* Unreliable - spell sometimes fizzles
* Ice Queen - when hit, the player has a chance of being frozen for a short period
* Toxic - player starts each floor poisoned
* Double Vision - will sometimes see enemies that aren't there
* Party Boy/Girl - dungeon is filled with party decorations, some of which are traps
* Hoarder - lots of debris/detritus spawns in the map and clutters pathways
* Smoker - smoke particle FX obscures portion of the screen
* Foodie - food spawns in dungeon; must periodically eat it or you take damage
* Completionist - must reveal entire dungeon before using the exit

### Quirks Still TBD
* Ghosted
* Fish pictures


### Finished Quirks
* ~~Partner in Crime - cops show up in the dungeon; dynamically scale to be strong but beatable~~
* ~~Gold Digger - all hearts replaced with coins~~
* ~~Clingy - enemies move faster; all enemies have reduced range before shooting projectiles~~
* ~~Explosive Personality - enemies will randomly drop bombs~~
* ~~Duckpic - ?? player somehow constantly receives pictures of ducks~~
* ~~Mansplain - enemies are obscured by text as the follower talks constantly~~
* ~~Nearsighted - map reveals at a much shorter distance~~
* ~~Spacey - sometimes player will walk in a random direction instead of the one chosen~~
* ~~Bad at Math - all numbers & health bars display incorrectly~~
* ~~Expensive Tastes - shop prices are more expensive~~
* ~~Wanted - more enemies spawn in the dungeon~~
* ~~Face Blind - all enemy models are changed to be random~~

### HUB Shops
